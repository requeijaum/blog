The Double-sided Modification Design Provides Extra Access To Strings And Octaves, And Offers Greater Control And Articulation In Sound Creation. The Extension Opens Up Several Opportunities To Enhance The Capacity Of The Instrument And Also Reduce Undesirable Overtones Inherent In The Older Design. This Is Made Possible By Providing Tuning Levers In The New Section, Where Previously The Strings Were In A Fixed Position And Could Not Be Adjusted. This Design Can Allow More Than One Performer (max. Of 4).","Double-sided Modification Design; Extension Opens; Extra Access; Fixed Position; New Section; Offers Greater Control; Older Design; One Performer max; Providing Tuning Levers; Several Opportunities; Single-sided Multi-stringed Instrument; Sound Creation; Undesirable Overtones","https://lens.org/030-684-015-362-863"
