      <description>I have been involved with text mining for quite a few years and I am a big fan of tidy text mining in R as popularised by Julia Silge and Daniel Robinson in Text Mining in R: A Tidy Approach. What I really like about tidy text mining is that we can keep track of the files where a word, a sentence or paragraph come from. This really matters when we want to join the results of tidy text mining to other data such as taxonomic information on species or to maps, or both.</description>
