      <title>Counting Patent First Filings the Tidy Way</title>

      <description>This article provides an introduction to counting patent first filings or priority counts. Counting first filings is an important subject for patent statistics because the first filing of a patent application marks the date that is closest to investment in research and development leading to the invention. For this reason it is widely used by economists and statisticians as a proxy indicator for the analysis of trends in science and technology.</description>

      <guid>/infographics/</guid>
      <description>In this article we will use RStudio to prepare patent data for visualisation in an infographic using the online software tool infogram.
Infographics are a popular way of presenting data in a way that is easy for a reader to understand without reading a long report. Infographics are well suited to presenting summaries of data with simple messages about key findings. A good infographic can encourage the audience to read a detailed report and is a tool for engagement with audiences during presentations of the findings of patent research.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this chapter we look at the use of the rplos package from rOpenSci to access the scientific literature from the Public Library of Science using the PLOS Search API.
The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is the main champion of open access peer reviewed scientific publications and has published somewhere in the region of 140,000 articles. These articles are a fantastic resource. PLOS includes the following titles.
 PLOS ONE PLOS Biology PLOS Medicine PLOS Computational Biology PLOS Genetics PLOS Pathogens PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases PLOS Clinical Trials () PLOS Collections (collections of articles)  PLOS is important because it provides open access to the full text of peer reviewed research.</description>

      <guid>/an-introduction-to-plotly-for-patent-analytics/</guid>
      <description>In this article we provide a quick introduction to the online graphing service Plotly to create graphics for use in patent analysis.
Plotly is an online graphing service that allows you to import excel, text and other files for visualisation. It also has API services for R, Python, MATLAB and a Plotly Javascript Library. This means that you can send data directly to Plotly for visualisation. Plots can also be shared with team mates or publicly.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article we provide a brief introduction to The Lens patent database as a free source of data for patent analytics.
The Lens is a patent database based in Australia that describes itself as “an open global cyberinfrastructure to make the innovation system more efficient and fair, more transparent and inclusive.” The main way it seeks to do this is by providing access to patent information with a particular focus on sequence information as well as analysis of issues such as DNA related patent activity.</description>

      <description>This post was updated in 2018 and you can read it here
The CRAN Project has the following to say about importing Excel files into R.
“The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible! If you have access to Excel, export the data you want from Excel in tab-delimited or comma-separated form, and use read.delim or read.csv to import it into R. (You may need to use read.</description>
