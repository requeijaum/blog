      <title>Counting Patent First Filings the Tidy Way with R</title>

      <guid>/counting-patent-first-filings/</guid>
      <description>This article provides an in depth introduction to counting patent first filings or priority counts. It is a work in progress chapter for the WIPO Patent Analytics Handbook focusing on advanced patent analytics and builds on the introductory WIPO Manual on Open Source Patent Analytics.
Counting first filings is an important subject for patent statistics because the first filing of a patent application marks the date that is closest to investment in research and development leading to the invention.</description>

      <title>Creating an Infographic with infogram</title>
      <link>/infographics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/infographics/</guid>
      <description>In this article we will use RStudio to prepare patent data for visualisation in an infographic using the online software tool infogram.
Infographics are a popular way of presenting data in a way that is easy for a reader to understand without reading a long report. Infographics are well suited to presenting summaries of data with simple messages about key findings. A good infographic can encourage the audience to read a detailed report and is a tool for engagement with audiences during presentations of the findings of patent research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scientific Literature with rplos</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/rplos-walkthrough/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this chapter we look at the use of the rplos package from rOpenSci to access the scientific literature from the Public Library of Science using the PLOS Search API.
The Public Library of Science (PLOS) is the main champion of open access peer reviewed scientific publications and has published somewhere in the region of 140,000 articles. These articles are a fantastic resource. PLOS includes the following titles.
 PLOS ONE PLOS Biology PLOS Medicine PLOS Computational Biology PLOS Genetics PLOS Pathogens PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases PLOS Clinical Trials () PLOS Collections (collections of articles)  PLOS is important because it provides open access to the full text of peer reviewed research.</description>

      <guid>/patent-datasets/</guid>
      <description>One problem for people seeking to learn patent analytics is a lack of access to patent data from different sources.
In this article I introduce the patent datasets developed for the WIPO Open Source Patent Analytics Project as training sets for patent analytics. The datasets will be used in the walkthroughs. The datasets will grow over time but we will briefly introduce them and explain how to access them.
The datasets are housed at the project GitHub repository.</description>

      <guid>/an-introduction-to-plotly-for-patent-analytics/</guid>
      <description>In this article we provide a quick introduction to the online graphing service Plotly to create graphics for use in patent analysis.
Plotly is an online graphing service that allows you to import excel, text and other files for visualisation. It also has API services for R, Python, MATLAB and a Plotly Javascript Library. This means that you can send data directly to Plotly for visualisation. Plots can also be shared with team mates or publicly.</description>

      <guid>/lens/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this article we provide a brief introduction to The Lens patent database as a free source of data for patent analytics.
The Lens is a patent database based in Australia that describes itself as “an open global cyberinfrastructure to make the innovation system more efficient and fair, more transparent and inclusive.” The main way it seeks to do this is by providing access to patent information with a particular focus on sequence information as well as analysis of issues such as DNA related patent activity.</description>

      <guid>/gephi_patent_network/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This article focuses on visualising patent data in networks using the open source software Gephi.
Gephi is one of a growing number of free network analysis and visualisation tools with others including Cytoscape, Tulip, GraphViz, Pajek for Windows, and VOSviewer to name but a few. In addition, network visualisation packages are available for R and Python. We have chosen to focus on Gephi because it is a good all round network visualisation tool that is quite easy to use and to learn.</description>

      <pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/tableau-patents/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this article we will be analysing and visualising patent data using Tableau Public.
Tableau Public is a free version of Tableau Desktop and provides a very good practical introduction to the use of patent data for analysis and visualisation. In many cases Tableau Public will represent the standard that other open source and free tools will need to meet.
This is a practical demonstration of the use of Tableau in patent analytics.</description>

Basic data cleaning using Open Refine Separating a patent dataset on applicant names and cleaning the names. Exporting a dataset from Open Refine at different stages in the cleaning process.  Open Refine is an open source tool for working with all types of messy data. It started life as Google Refine but has since migrated to Open Refine.</description>
