    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Back in 2015 I wrote a blog post on importing Excel tables into R. Happily for everyone this is now a lot easier than it was. This post provides a quick update on importing and exporting to Excel.</p>
<div id="import-directly-from-the-rstudio-menu" class="section level3">
<h3>Import Directly from the RStudio Menu</h3>
<p>The big change is that it is now very easy to import using the RStudio Menu: File &gt; Import Dataset &gt; From Excel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/excel/file_import.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Next, navigate to the file that you want to import and select it. You will then see something like this.</p>
<p><img src="/images/excel/import_panel.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>One point to bear in mind is that the import will often default to the name <code>dataset</code> so that you need to make sure you enter a meaningful name for the dataset.</p>
<p>If your workbook has multiple sheets then you can choose a sheet number or choose to skip rows if you have a bunch of filler junk in the top rows.</p>
<p><img src="/images/excel/import_panel_options.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You can also click on a column and choose to skip it or change the format.</p>
<p><img src="/images/excel/skip_col.png" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that if you are importing a number of worksheets you can lose track. I sometimes use the approach of copying the import chunk into an Rmarkdown document to keep track of what I am doing and where a file came from.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
taxonomy &lt;- read_excel(&quot;/Users/pauloldham17inch/Desktop/taxonomy_final.xlsx&quot;)
taxonomy</code></pre>
<p>As we can see from importing the file behind the scenes RStudio is using the <code>readxl</code> library to import the file.</p>
<p>We can also see that there are some messages that are generated during the import process. For example this dataset generated a long string of warnings that looked like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Expecting logical in AH5501 / R5501C34: got &#39;Aaptos suberitoides&#39;Expecting logical in AH5502 / R5502C34: got &#39;Abdopus abaculus&#39;Expecting logical in AH5503 / R5503C34: got &#39;Abdopus aculeatus&#39;Expecting logical in AH5504 / R5504C34: got &#39;Abralia armata&#39;Expecting logical in AH5505 / R5505C34: got &#39;Abraliopsis hoylei&#39;Expecting logical in AH5506 / R5506C34: got &#39;Abudefduf bengalensis&#39;Expecting logical in AH5507 / R5507C34: got &#39;Abudefduf sexfasciatus&#39;</code></pre>
<p>These arise because <code>readxl</code> guesses the column type by reading the top 1000 rows for each column. However, where a column contains a mix of numbers or characters this can lead to an <code>expecting integer/expecting logical</code> type of error. A lot of the time this is not actually a problem. However, it is important to pay attention to the warnings because it may in fact be a problem indicating some kind of corruption in your data.</p>
<p>To fix this you can try a number of options</p>
<p><strong>1. Use the guess_max argument</strong></p>
<p>Use the <code>guess_max</code> argument to increase the number of rows that are read to guess the column type. In the case of our example dataset this didn’t work because the problems are found in the last few rows but it often will. You can add an <code>n_max</code> value (shown below as NULL) where you know the maximum number of rows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readxl)
taxonomy &lt;- read_excel(&quot;/Users/pauloldham17inch/Desktop/open_source_master/asean/data-taxonomy/taxonomy_final.xlsx&quot;, guess_max = min(2000, n_max = NULL))</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. Specify the column types </strong></p>
<p>If that doesn’t work for you then the third option is to work out what the format should be and pass it as a string.</p>
<p>A toy example is the following data frame that we can write to excel (below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- tibble(a = c(1,2,3), b = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), d = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), e = c(&quot;2017-12-10&quot;, &quot;20170815&quot;, &quot;2017_06_12&quot;)) %&gt;% writexl::write_xlsx(., &quot;df.xlsx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>When we read this in we specify the column types. Note that in this case we need to use the term “text” rather than the familiar “character” or we get an error.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_excel(&quot;/Users/pauloldham17inch/Desktop/open_source_master/blog/content/post/df.xlsx&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = c(&quot;numeric&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;, &quot;text&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The documentation for read_excel sets out quite a few other options. For example we could specify the format of some columns and leave the function to guess the others. That would look like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_excel(&quot;/Users/pauloldham17inch/Desktop/open_source_master/blog/content/post/df.xlsx&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = c(&quot;guess&quot;, &quot;guess&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;, &quot;guess&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Convert all columns to a single type</strong></p>
<p>For a dataset with a lot of columns trying to work out the column types or writing <code>guess, logical, character</code> can rapidly become painful. Depending on your needs it is often easier to simply use the <code>col_types = &quot;text&quot;</code> for all columns and change them where needed later using <code>as.character()</code>, <code>as.logical()</code>, <code>as.numeric()</code> or <code>as.Date()</code>.</p>

<p>With our toy dataset we could easily change the columns that are our target as needed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df$a &lt;- as.numeric(df$a)</code></pre>
<p>Dates can be troublesome and in cases where you need to format date fields the <a href="http://lubridate.tidyverse.org/"><code>lubridate</code></a> package will really make your life a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>In our toy dataset case while the dates are all in YYYYMMDD format (and those in your dataset may not be) the separators are different and using <code>as.Date()</code> won’t work for the second and third dates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as.Date(df$e)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2017-12-10&quot; NA           NA</code></pre>
<p>However, this problem is easily handled by <code>lubridate::as_date</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(lubridate)
df$e &lt;- as_date(df$e)</code></pre>
<p>Charlotte Wickham offers an incredibly useful DataCamp course <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-dates-and-times-in-r">Working with Dates and Times in R</a> that will have you up and running in no time.</p>

<div id="tidying-column-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidying column names</h3>
<p>One issue once you have your data in R is that column names in excel files often contain mixed case names and spaces or other characters such as brackets that can be awkward to work with in R. To solve that an easy option is to use the recent <code>janitor</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;janitor&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(janitor)
df &lt;- janitor::clean_names(df)</code></pre>
<p>This does a pretty good job of cleaning up names but is not perfect. If you have particular needs try using the <code>stringr</code> package that is now part of the <code>tidyverse</code> packages. Assuming you have used <code>install:packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code> you can then call the library and use the following <code>stringr</code> function to tidy the names up.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
names(df) &lt;- str_replace_all(names(df),&quot;[(]|[)]|[[:space:]]&quot;, &quot;_&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I’ve chosen some of the harder ones to remember here as brackets need to be escaped. The above will replace brackets and spaces with an underscore. Whether that is what you want is another matter but it will help you to get started. If you need more help try the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf">Basic Regular Expressions Cheatsheet in R</a> or the chapter on strings in Hadley Wickham’s book <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html">R for Data Science</a>. Charlotte Wickham also offers a Data Camp course on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/string-manipulation-in-r-with-stringr">String Manipulation in R with stringr</a>. When it comes to working with strings <code>stringr</code> is your friend and if that doesn’t solve the problem then try the <code>stringi</code> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="exporting-to-excel" class="section level2">
<h2>Exporting to Excel</h2>
<p>In the earlier post I wrote about using <code>write.xlsx()</code> from the <code>xlsx</code> package. However, I have now switched over to the <code>writexl</code> package as I find it easier to remember and use. It is also an <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/writexl">ROpenSci package</a> and I use a lot of ROpenSci packages. <code>writexl</code> has the added bonus that Clippy appears in the documentation to brighten up your day… or drive you insane.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;writexl&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We simply specify the file and the name of the file we want to write. An additional argument col_names = TRUE is set to TRUE by default so you only need to specify that if you want the value to be FALSE.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(writexl)
writexl::write_xlsx(df, path = &quot;df.xlsx&quot;, col_names = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>You can also write multiple sheets by specifying the data frames in a list and passing them to write_xlsx.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#TO OD
#tmp &lt;- list(&quot;df1&quot;, &quot;df2&quot;)
#write_xlsx(tmp, &quot;tmp.xlsx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>There we have it, reading and writing Excel files in R if you have to is now really very easy.</p>
